# Malaria Infection Detector : Project Overview🎯
### A Machine Learning based web application to detect the malaria infection in the given cell image.
 - Deep Learning Model - Customized version of VGG16 Model Architecture
 - The model was trained on 22048 images belonging to 2 classes (Uninfected / Parasitized) and validated on 5510 images.
 - Training accuracy - 0.972 **&** Validation accuracy - 0.947
 - Developed a user interface using Flask to upload image and see results.
